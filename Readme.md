## Scripts
#### A folder for self-made bash/zsh scripts (mostly for linux).
Contains:
1. **texclear**: Whenever I exit vim, this scripts deletes the latex build files. It is called from the (neo)vim config.
2. **battery**: When "battery" is called it outputs the remaining charge and the status of the laptop's battery.
3. **wrire**: "Write report". Creates a folder called *report*, and the file *rep.tex* and *rep.pdf*, which contain a template for a latex report. It can also be called as "wrire img", which makes the program create an *img* folder insde *report*.
