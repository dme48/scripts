## Scripts
#### A folder for self-made bash/zsh scripts (mostly for linux).
Contains:
1. **texclear**: Whenever I exit vim, this scripts deletes the latex build files. It is called from the (neo)vim config.
2. **battery**: When "battery" is called it outputs the remaining charge and the status of the laptop's battery.
